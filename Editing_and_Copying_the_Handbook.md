### Editing and Copying the Handbook

This page is for future users who want to edit this handbook or who want to make a handbook of their own. 

**Fork a Copy**: The easiest way to adapt this handbook is to clone the Group Handbook repo from the Kulkarni Group [Github](https://github.com/kul-group) and edit it yourself. See below for editing details.

**Starting your own copy**: To make your own handbook, start a Github repository and begin adding pages written in markdown formatting. Make sure the page titles have no spaces and end with `.md`. This will help with converting your handbook to a website.

#### Basic Editing

See [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) for a Markdown guide. Though knowing basic Markdown will serve most of your needs, it is useful to know that Github uses slightly different Markdown called ["Github Flavored Markdown"](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) which differs in some places. 

##### Headings

Put several hashes in front of your heading, more hashes means a smaller heading. For example `### Heading` will be smaller than `## Heading` when the document is rendered.
