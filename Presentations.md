### Presentations

Effectively communicating your work is essential to being a productive researcher. Presentations are used to update the group, communicate with other groups, and play a central role in your future exams and interviews. The following guidelines focus on how to create clear, effective presentations.

#### Slides

1. Keep your slides simple. Your audience will have a hard time absorbing a lot of text or data at once. It is better to break things up over multiple slides.

2. Use fewer words. Most audience members do not read the words on the slide (myself included). It is better to use a few words to note the main takaways and remind you what to discuss. For example, "Sn Zeolite -> Regioselectivity" is better than "Tin containing zeolite catalysts show higher regioselectivity". If it is important for your audience to know, say it yourself, because the audience will not necessarily read the words.

3. Use images. Well labeled Images are the best way to explain your point. Oftentimes, a well labeled plot is the only thing you need on a slide to illustrate your point.

4. Use an outline. Have a slide at the beginning of your talk going over the outline, remind the audience where you are in the outline at each step in the presentation.

5. Use backup slides if you must. Some students include a lot of background and justification in their slides in preparation for potential questions
