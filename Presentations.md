### Presentations

Effectively communicating your work is essential to being a productive researcher. Presentations are used to update the group, communicate with other groups, and play a central role in your future exams and interviews. The following guidelines focus on how to create clear, effective presentations. See the [Prelim](https://github.com/kul-group/Group-Handbook/blob/master/Preliminary%20Examination.md#preliminary-examination) and [QE](https://github.com/kul-group/Group-Handbook/blob/master/Qualifying%20Examination.md#qualifying-examination) pages for more details on these specific presentations. The [Data Visualization](https://github.com/kul-group/Group-Handbook/blob/master/Data%20Visualization.md#data-visualization) page can help with formatting images in your presentation.

#### Slides

1. Keep your slides simple. Your audience will have a hard time absorbing a lot of text or data at once. It is better to break things up over multiple slides.

2. Use fewer words. Most audience members do not read the words on the slide (myself included). It is better to use a few words to note the main takaways and remind you what to discuss. For example, "Sn Zeolite -> Regioselectivity" is better than "Tin containing zeolite catalysts show higher regioselectivity". If it is important for your audience to know, say it yourself, because the audience will not necessarily read the words.

3. Use images. Well labeled Images are the best way to explain your point. Oftentimes, a well labeled plot is the only thing you need on a slide to illustrate your point.

4. Use an outline. Have a slide at the beginning of your talk going over the outline, remind the audience where you are in the outline at each step in the presentation.

5. Use backup slides. Some students include a lot of background and justification in their slides in preparation for potential questions. This is not the best approach since the additional content can distract the audience. Instead, include slides designed to explain a particular concept or answer a question at the end of your presentation. That way, you can refer to these backup slides (if a question comes up) without distracting from your main point in the presentation.

6. Include proper attributions and acknowledgements: Make sure to cite your sources, and acknowledge the people that helped you and your research.
