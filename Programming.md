### Programming

Python Coding guidelines:

Materials covered in ECS 32B:
Two main topics:
#### Object-oriented programming (OOP)
OOP is a coding style where we define both the type of the data structures and functions that can be applied to those data structures. This way of treating data structures as objects allows the programmers to build connections between different objects; for example, one inherits characteristics from another. Another advantage compared to sequential coding is that OOP enables programmers to dissect a problem into sections where we call them classes without constantly having to worry about the whole picture.
#### Data structures and algorithms
Understanding data structures, such as arrays, trees, heaps, graphs and Python built-ins, allows programmers to store information where it can be accessed efficiently (Beginner theorists may not be needing this as much as OOP)
Smaller topics:
#### Debug & Unit testing
Pycharm has fancy debugging tools that allow programmers to step into the code and update all local variables after executing each line of code. Unit testing is an essential part of OOP since it helps to verify that the parts of the program (functions) do return results that match our expectations. For that reason, the test cases are usually written along with the program.
#### Type hinting
Type hints are hints that are given to the variables; for example, the inputs and outputs of a function, regarding their data types. It is useful especially when multiple programmers are working on the same project.
#### Inheritance
Objects with similar properties can inherit characteristics from the parent object without rewriting everything from the parent object. For example, different types of zeolite objects such as MFI inherits from the zeolite class. The child objects can also override the methods inherited from the parent.
