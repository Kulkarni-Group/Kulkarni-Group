## Literature

This section goes over general advice for how to read papers, find relevant publications, organize your literature, and suggests which papers to read for each subgroup.

### Reading Tips

Tips for keeping track of literature and reading more efficiently: 

- Use Mendeley to organize the literature. Use the watch folder functionality. 
- Read in the following order: conclusions/ summary --> intro --> figures/ captions --> whole paper 
- summarize the main results in a power point slide
- Practice makes perfect
- Be judicious with your time, focus on paper sections with info which is new to you and be picky about the papers you read.
- For many papers, initially read only the introduction section and look at the figures. The introduction gives you the background/significance of the work and summarizes the papers approach and results.

### Finding Papers
