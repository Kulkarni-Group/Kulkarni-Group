### Qualifying Examination

#### What to expect

The qualifying examination, or QE, is an oral exam typically taken in the spring quarter of your second year.
It consists of a 30 minute presentation along with questions from the commitee which typically takes 2.5 hours.
The focus of the presentation is to outline your research plan for the rest of your PhD, including previous research,
theory, and a timeline for future work.

#### Writing the Dissertation

#### Advice

- An easy QE is just a well prepared QE.
- Make a full rough draft of QE presentation over winter break.
- Practice in January with a few different people, make changes.
- Get the low-down on professors and schedule the exam ASAP to make the stress real. Scheduling time with professors is hard so do this at least 3 months in advance. 
- Also scheduling 5 professors is not always easy so do it early.
- 2 months before exam, practice every day by yourself with slides, then eventually without slides, burn the images and words into your memory. 
- I did this while walking to get in exercise and learn to change attention. 
- Questions will come up in your head, find the answers if unknown and practice answering during solo practice too.
- Practice with group(s), multiple times! I did 5 full practices in moule group, do it until its easy. 
- Your committee members are encouraged to sit with you and hear your QE, take advantage of that
